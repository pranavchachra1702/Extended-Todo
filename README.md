# Extended-Todo
Build a serverless React Native mobile Todolist app by using AWS Amplify

Attributes of a Todo item are Name, Description and a list of comments. One ToDo can have one or more comments. When we view a ToDo, we should be able to see the comments for the ToDo and also be able to add one.

Eg: 

If Todo is:

Name: "Buy Groceries"

Description: "Purchase vegetables, fruits, and milk from the supermarket."

Comments:

"Remember to also grab some eggs."

"Check for any ongoing promotions."

and we add a comment :

"Don't forget to bring reusable shopping bags."

So modified Todo would store:

Name: "Buy Groceries"

Description: "Purchase vegetables, fruits, and milk from the supermarket."

Comments:

"Remember to also grab some eggs."

"Check for any ongoing promotions."

"Don't forget to bring reusable shopping bags."
